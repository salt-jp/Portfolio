# Portfolio and Reflection
This is the collection of the before and after products of the projects I retouched for my final portfolio assignment. 
Overall I'm really proud of myself for not just giving up in this class when I got overwhelmed. These projetcs I'm showing off are not necessarily impressive, but they are important to me because they opened up a whole new medium of art for me to expiriment with. This really tested my creativity, because I had to think way outside of the box to even think where to start on these assignments. It kind of felt like, I was shown a video on how to swim, then immediatley thrown into the deep end of a pool and just told "go!" But it was a lot of fun. I think as a person, it has expanded my knowledge more on art and how to approach it. I am a visual artist who knows how to draw and create straight from my brain to my canvas, so having to adapt to make art using code or other new approaches was really interesting. I learned that AI and code can do a lot of the same things I can do with my own hands, so its really odd to think about. Maybe in the future I will incoroporate what I learned into my everyday art since now I have a very basic understanding of code! However, I would definitley need to take another class or two first so I actually understand what the things I am writing doen mean, but I'm open to it! 


# Key:
OG = Original code. The files starting with 'OG' is the code I edited for this project.

NEW = New code. This is the final product of the code.
