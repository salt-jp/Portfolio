# Portfolio
This is the collection of the before and after products of the projects I retouched for my final portfolio assignment. 
Overall I'm really proud of myself for not just giving up in this class when I got overwhelmed. These projetcs I'm showing off are not necessarily impressive, but they are important to me because they opened up a whole new medium of art for me to expiriment with. This really tested my creativity, because I had to think way outside of th ebox to even think where to start on these assignments. It kind of felt like, I was shown a video on how to swim, then immediatley thrown into the deep end of a pool and just told "go!" But it was a lot of fun regardless. 
# Key:
OG = Original code. The files starting with 'OG' is the code I edited for this project.

NEW = New code. This is the final product of the code.
